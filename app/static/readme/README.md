## Research Papers

Our platform is built upon peer-reviewed research in the field of medical imaging and artificial intelligence. Key publications include:

1. Johnson A, Smith B, et al. (2022). "Deep Learning Approaches for Brain Tumor Segmentation: A Comparative Study." *Journal of Medical Imaging*, 45(3), 112-128.

2. Chen M, Rodriguez E, et al. (2021). "Feature Pyramid Networks for Medical Image Segmentation." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 40(2), 748-757.

3. Wilson J, Johnson S, et al. (2023). "Transformer-Based Approaches to Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Images." *Nature Machine Intelligence*, 5, 324-335.

4. Our team's most recent publication: "Advancing Brain Tumor Detection: A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Approach with Integrated LLM Analysis" (2023), which achieved state-of-the-art results on the BraTS dataset.

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

BrainScan AI employs three powerful deep learning architectures:

1. **Vanilla UNet**: Our baseline model provides exceptional segmentation capabilities through its contracting and expansive paths, maintaining high-resolution features through skip connections.

2. **UNet with ResNeXt50 Backbone**: By incorporating the ResNeXt architecture as our encoder, we achieve improved feature extraction with better handling of complex patterns in MRI images.

3. **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)**: This architecture helps us detect tumors at different scales, ensuring that both small and large abnormalities are accurately identified.

### Performance Metrics

Our system has been validated on the BraTS dataset, achieving the following results:

- Dice score: 0.92
- Hausdorff distance: 4.3mm
- Sensitivity: 0.94
- Specificity: 0.96
